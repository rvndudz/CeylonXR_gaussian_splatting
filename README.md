## Building from source and running locally
Navigate to the code directory and run
```
npm install
```
Next run the build. For Linux & Mac OS systems run:
```
npm run build
```
For Windows I have added a Windows-compatible version of the build command:
```
npm run build-windows
```
To view the demo scenes locally run
```
npm run demo
```
The demo will be accessible locally at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html). You will need to download the data for the demo scenes and extract them into 
```
<code directory>/build/demo/assets/data
```
